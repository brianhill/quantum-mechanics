### Week 1 &mdash; Introduction to Quantum-Mechanical Interference &mdash; Introduction to Complex Variables

* Monday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Reading: Churchill, Brown & Verhey (hereafter, just &ldquo;CBV&rdquo;), Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Volume III Chapter 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 1: Keevan
* Thursday, Jan. 15 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Chapter III-2 &mdash; Problem Set 2: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading; Feynman 27.12, 27.14 and 27.21 &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 2: Lucinda

### Week 2 &mdash; Mathematics of Classical and Quantum-Mechanical Wave Interference and Diffraction

* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader: Grisha
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Finish Feynman's exercise 21.1 (to do both the even and odd case you are going to need another identity for the sum of the odd powers of z like the one you derived for all the powers of z in CBV problem 14); Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; In Feynman's exercise book, do Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6 &mdash; Seminar leader: Keevan

### Week 3 &mdash;

* Monday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Reading: Continue Feynman through Chapter 3 Section 2 (through means up to _and including_) &mdash; Problem Set 4: Wolfson, Chapter 14, Problems #24 (see commentary on Problem 24 below) and #46, Feynman Problems 27.6, 27.7, and 27.20, and my Gaussian problem below
* Commentary on Problem 24: Make it a four-part problem: (a) Put y<sub>1</sub>(x,t)=f<sub>1</sub>(x-vt) into the equation. Take the partial derivatives. What does that demand about v? This is a right-moving wave (assuming the direction of increasing x is to the right). Is there any restriction on the function f<sub>1</sub> other than it be twice differentiable? (b) Put y<sub>2</sub>(x,t)=f<sub>2</sub>(x+vt) into the equation. Does it work with the same demand on v? This is a left-moving wave. There is no restriction on f<sub>2</sub> other than it be twice differentiable. Popular choices for f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are the sines and cosines you so often see. (c) Given that y<sub>3</sub>(x,t) and y<sub>4</sub>(x,t) are solutions, show that y<sub>3</sub>(x,t)+y<sub>4</sub>(x,t) is a solution. This is the principle of superposition. The sum of any two solutions is a solution! Of course the difference is a solution too. In fact any linear combination is c<sub>3</sub>&times;y<sub>3</sub>(x,t)+c<sub>4</sub>&times;y<sub>4</sub>(x,t). (d) If the tank is 1.5 inches deep, and the acceleration of gravity is 32 ft / second-squared, what is the speed of the water waves in feet per second? Plugging in the numbers is elementary, but a simple problem like this is a good opportunity to check that you can track units carefully, including the conversion factor from feet to inches.
* Gaussian Problem: In quantum mechanics, a Gaussian probability amplitude,  e^(-x<sup>2</sup>/2a). when squared, becomes a Gaussian probability distribution, and it is something which is e^(-x<sup>2</sup>/a). (a) Integrate this function from minus infinity to infinity. What would the _amplitude_ have to be multiplied by so that after squaring and integrating you got 1? This is called normalization. (b) Take your normalized probability distribution, multiply it by x<sup>2</sup>, and integrate that from minus infinity to infinity. You can do this integral without looking it up if you change 1/a to &alpha; and realize that the extra x<sup>2</sup> in the integrand can be obtained by taking minus the derivative respect to &alpha; of the integral you previously did. Sneaky, eh?
* Thursday, Jan. 29 &mdash; Conclude Chapter III-3

### Week 4 &mdash; Exam 1 &mdash;

* Monday, Feb. 2 &mdash; Exam 1 on CBV, Chapter 1, Wolfson, Chapter 14, and Feynman, Chapters I-29, I-30, III-1, III-2, and III-3 (glossing Feynman's emphasis on crystal diffraction patterns, even though they are experimentally and scientifically extremely important for discovering the lattice structure of crystals)
