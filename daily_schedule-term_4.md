* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens the CBV reading
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Feynman Problem 21.1; Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; Feynman Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6

### Week 3 &mdash; Notation and Rules for Combining Quantum-Mechanical Probability Amplitudes

* Monday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Reading: Continue Feynman through III-3-2 (through means up to _and including_) &mdash; Problem Set 5: Wolfson, Chapter 14, Problems #24 and #46, Feynman Problems 27.6, 27.7, and 27.20, and my Gaussian problem
* Thursday, Jan. 29 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter III-3 &mdash; Problem Set 6: 1. Just for practice with the notation, write out Eq. 3.6 and the un-numbered equation that precedes it for the case where the first screen contains three slits, 1, 2, and 3, and the second screen contains two slits, a and b, and don't use ellipses, write all 6 terms out; 2. Do my handout; 3. 70.1; 4. 70.2; 5. 70.6; 6. 70.8

### Week 4 &mdash; Exam 1 &mdash; Bose-Einstein Statistics

* Monday, Feb. 2 &mdash; [Exam 1](./exams/Exam1.nb.pdf) on CBV, Chapter 1, Wolfson, Chapter 14, and Feynman, Chapters I-29, I-30, III-1, III-2, and III-3 (glossing the Bohr atom, the Uncertainty Principle, and Feynman's emphasis on crystal diffraction patterns, even though the latter are experimentally and scientifically extremely important for discovering the lattice structure of crystals)
* Thursday, Feb. 5 &mdash; Reading: Feynman Chapter III-4 through Section III-4-4 &mdash; Review Section III-3-4 where identical particles were first introduced &mdash; Problem Set 7: 1. Exam Problem 4; 2. Exam Extra Credit Problem 6

* Thursday, Feb. 12
