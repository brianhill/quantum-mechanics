### Week 1 &mdash; Introduction to Quantum-Mechanical Interference &mdash; Introduction to Complex Variables

* Monday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Reading: Churchill, Brown & Verhey (hereafter, just &ldquo;CBV&rdquo;), Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Volume III (hereafter, just &ldquo;Feynman&rdquo;), Chapter 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 1: Keevan
* Thursday, Jan. 15 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Chapter 2 &mdash; Problem Set 2: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading; Feynman 27.12, 27.14 and 27.21 &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 2: Lucinda

### Week 2 &mdash; Mathematics of Classical and Quantum-Mechanical Wave Interference and Diffraction

* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader: Grisha
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Finish Feynman's exercise 21.1 (to do both the even and odd case you are going to need another identity for the sum of the odd powers of z like the one you derived for all the powers of z in CBV problem 14); Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; In Feynman's exercise book, do Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6 &mdash; Seminar leader: Keevan

### Week 3 &mdash;

* Monday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Reading: &mdash; Problem Set 4: Wolfson, Chapter 14, Problems #24 (see commentary on Problem 24 below) and #46, Feynman Problems 27.6, xxx, yyy, zzz
* Commentary on Problem 24: Make it a four-part problem: (a) Put y1(x,t)=f1(x-vt) into the equation. Take the partial derivatives. What does that demand about v? This is a right-moving wave (assuming the direction of increasing x is to the right). Is there any restriction on f1 other than it be twice differentiable? (b) Put y2(x,t)=f2(x+vt) into the equation. Does it work with the same demand on v? This is a left-moving wave. There is no restriction on f2 other than it be twice differentiable. (c) Given that y3(x,t) and y4(x,t) are solutions, show that y3(x,t)+y4(x,t) is a solution. This is the principle of superposition. The sum of any two solutions is a solution! Of course the difference is a solution too. In fact any linear combination is a*y3(x,t)+b*y4(x,t). (d) If the tank is 1.5 inches deep, and the acceleration of gravity is 32 ft / second-squared, what is the speed of the water waves in feet per second? Plugging in the numbers is elementary, but a simple problem like this is a good opportunity to check that you can track units carefully, including the conversion factor from feet to inches.
