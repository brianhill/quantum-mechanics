### Week 1 &mdash; Introduction to Quantum-Mechanical Interference &mdash; Introduction to Complex Variables

* Monday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Reading: Churchill, Brown & Verhey (hereafter, just &ldquo;CBV&rdquo;), Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Volume III Chapter 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 1: Keevan
* Thursday, Jan. 15 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Chapter III-2 &mdash; Problem Set 2: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading; Feynman 27.12, 27.14 and 27.21 &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 2: Lucinda

### Week 2 &mdash; Mathematics of Classical and Quantum-Mechanical Wave Interference and Diffraction

* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader: Grisha
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Finish Feynman's exercise 21.1 (to do both the even and odd case you are going to need another identity for the sum of the odd powers of z like the one you derived for all the powers of z in CBV problem 14); Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; In Feynman's exercise book, do Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6 &mdash; Seminar leader: Keevan

### Week 3 &mdash; Notation and Rules for Combining Quantum-Mechanical Probability Amplitudes

* Monday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Reading: Continue Feynman through Chapter 3 Section 2 (through means up to _and including_) &mdash; Problem Set 5: Wolfson, Chapter 14, Problems #24 and #46, Feynman Problems 27.6, 27.7, and 27.20, and my Gaussian problem
* Thursday, Jan. 29 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter III-3 &mdash; Problem Set 6: 1. Just for practice with the notation, write out Eq. 3.6 and the un-numbered equation that precedes it for the case where the first screen contains three slits, 1, 2, and 3, and the second screen contains two slits, a and b, and don't use ellipses, write all 6 terms out; 2. Do my handout; 3. 70.1; 4. 70.2; 5. 70.6 (don't be intimidated, just let Feynman guide you through all the steps the way he has broken the problem down); 6. 70.8

### Week 4 &mdash; Exam 1 &mdash; Identical Particles

* Monday, Feb. 2 &mdash; Exam 1 on CBV, Chapter 1, Wolfson, Chapter 14, and Feynman, Chapters I-29, I-30, III-1, III-2, and III-3 (glossing the Bohr atom, the Uncertainty Principle, and Feynman's emphasis on crystal diffraction patterns, even though the latter are experimentally and scientifically extremely important for discovering the lattice structure of crystals)
* Thursday, Feb. 5 &mdash; Reading: Feynman Chapter III-4 (and review Section III-3-4 where idential particles were first introduced)
