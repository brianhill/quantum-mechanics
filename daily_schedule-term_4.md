### Week 1 &mdash; Introduction to Quantum-Mechanical Interference &mdash; Introduction to Complex Variables

* Monday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Reading: Churchill, Brown & Verhey (hereafter, just &ldquo;CBV&rdquo;), Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Volume III Chapter 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1: All the evens in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 1: Keevan
* Thursday, Jan. 15 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Chapter III-2 &mdash; Problem Set 2: All the evens, in the CBV reading; Feynman 27.12, 27.14 and 27.21 &mdash; Seminar leader: Lucinda

### Week 2 &mdash; Mathematics of Classical and Quantum-Mechanical Wave Interference and Diffraction

* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader: Grisha
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Feynman Problem 21.1; Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; Feynman Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6 &mdash; Seminar leader: Keevan

### Week 3 &mdash; Notation and Rules for Combining Quantum-Mechanical Probability Amplitudes

* Monday, Jan. 26 &mdash; Reading: Continue Feynman through III-3-2 (through means up to _and including_) &mdash; Problem Set 5: Wolfson, Chapter 14, Problems #24 and #46, Feynman Problems 27.6, 27.7, and 27.20, and my Gaussian problem
* Thursday, Jan. 29 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter III-3 &mdash; Problem Set 6: 1. Just for practice with the notation, write out Eq. 3.6 and the un-numbered equation that precedes it for the case where the first screen contains three slits, 1, 2, and 3, and the second screen contains two slits, a and b, and don't use ellipses, write all 6 terms out; 2. Do my handout; 3. 70.1; 4. 70.2; 5. 70.6; 6. 70.8

### Week 4 &mdash; Exam 1 &mdash; Identical Bose-Einstein Particles

* Monday, Feb. 2 &mdash; [Exam 1](./exams/Exam1.nb.pdf) on CBV, Chapter 1, Wolfson, Chapter 14, and Feynman, Chapters I-29, I-30, III-1, III-2, and III-3 (glossing the Bohr atom, the Uncertainty Principle, and Feynman's emphasis on crystal diffraction patterns, even though the latter are experimentally and scientifically extremely important for discovering the lattice structure of crystals)
* Thursday, Feb. 5 &mdash; Reading: Feynman Chapter III-4 through Section III-4-4 (again, through means up to _and including_), and not Section III-4-5 or beyond &mdash; Review Section III-3-4 where identical particles were first introduced &mdash; Problem Set 7: 1., Exam Problem 4 (you will find a nice start on Problem 4 in my exam solution in your file folders); 2. Exam Problem 6; 3. Feynman Problem 71.1; 4. Feynman Problem 71.4 (it could be a stretch, but I think you can do it after studying Section III-4-4); 5. Feynman Problem 71.7 (just follow your nose, and you don't need to know much about black-body radiation to do this problem except the formula he gives in the problem) &mdash; I will introduce you to the remainder of Chapter III-4

### Week 5 &mdash; Black-Body Radiation &mdash; Identical Fermi-Dirac Particles

* Monday, Feb. 9
* Thursay, Feb. 12
