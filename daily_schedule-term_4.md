### Week 1 &mdash; Introduction to Quantum-Mechanical Interference &mdash; Introduction to Complex Variables

* Monday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Reading: Churchill, Brown & Verhey (hereafter, just &ldquo;CBV&rdquo;), Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Volume III (hereafter, just &ldquo;Feynman&rdquo;), Chapter 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 1: Keevan
* Thursday, Jan. 15 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 1; Feynman, Chapter 2 &mdash; Problem Set 2: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading; Feynman 27.12, 27.14 and 27.21 &mdash; Seminar leader for Feynman Chapter 2: Lucinda

### Week 2 &mdash; Mathematics of Classical and Quantum-Mechanical Wave Interference and Diffraction

* Monday, Jan. 19 &mdash; Reading: CBV, Sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 1; Start Feynman, Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 3: All the evens, and optionally the odds, in the CBV reading &mdash; Seminar leader: Grisha
* Thursday, Jan. 22 &mdash; Feynman, Conclude Chapter I-29 and part of I-30 &mdash; Problem Set 4: Finish Feynman's exercise 21.1 (to do both the even and odd case you are going to need another identity for the sum of the odd powers of z like the one you derived for all the powers of z in CBV problem 14); Derive the actual function of angle (not just the location of nodes and anti-nodes) for all the situations Feynman detailed in Chapter I-29; In Feynman's exercise book, do Problems 21.4, 21.5, and 21.6 &mdash; Seminar leader: Keevan
